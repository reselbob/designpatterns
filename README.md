# Understadning Design Patterns Using Typescript

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to provide examples of the basic software design patterns that are in general use in many software development initiatives.

Presently this project covers three patterns:

* [Command](./command)
* [Strategy](./strategy)
* [Factory](./factory)

More are under development.

## Why TypeScript?

This project implements the design patterns in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The reason TypeScript is used is because the programming language is enjoying a growing popularity. TypeScript enforces the concepts and discipline that are essential to Object Oriented Programming. Yet, that it [transpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) down to JavaScript, makes applications written in TypeScript applicable to any target environment that supports JavaScript. 

TypeScript offers both power and versatility. It's a compelling programming language for writing applications and services that are intended to run on the Internet.
